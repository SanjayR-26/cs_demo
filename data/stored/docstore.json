Architectural works, in the material form of buildings, are often perceived as cultural symbols and as works of art. Historical civilisations are often identified with their surviving architectural achievements.[6]\r\n\r\nThe practice, which began in the prehistoric era, has been used as a way of expressing culture by civilizations on all seven continents.[7] For this reason, architecture is considered to be a form of art. Texts on architecture have been written since ancient times. The earliest surviving text on architectural theories is the 1st century AD treatise De architectura by the Roman architect Vitruvius, according to whom a good building embodies firmitas, utilitas, and venustas (durability, utility, and beauty). Centuries later, Leon Battista Alberti developed his ideas further, seeing beauty as an objective quality of buildings to be found in their proportions. In the 19th century, Louis Sullivan declared that \"form follows function\". \"Function\" began to replace the classical \"utility\" and was understood to include not only practical but also aesthetic, psychological, and cultural dimensions. The idea of sustainable architecture was introduced in the late 20th century.\r\n\r\nArchitecture began as rural, oral vernacular architecture that developed from trial and error to successful replication. Ancient urban architecture was preoccupied with building religious structures and buildings symbolizing the political power of rulers until Greek and Roman architecture shifted focus to civic virtues. Indian and Chinese architecture influenced forms all over Asia and Buddhist architecture in particular took diverse local flavors. During the Middle Ages, pan-European styles of Romanesque and Gothic cathedrals and abbeys emerged while the Renaissance favored Classical forms implemented by architects known by name. Later, the roles of architects and engineers became separated.\r\n\r\nModern architecture began after World War I as an avant-garde movement that sought to develop a completely new style appropriate for a new post-war social and economic order focused on meeting the needs of the middle and working classes. Emphasis was put on modern techniques, materials, and simplified geometric forms, paving the way for high-rise superstructures. Many architects became disillusioned with modernism which they perceived as ahistorical and anti-aesthetic, and postmodern and contemporary architecture developed. Over the years, the field of architectural construction has branched out to include everything from ship design to interior decorating.\r\n\r\nDefinitions\r\nArchitecture can mean:\r\n\r\nA general term to describe buildings and other physical structures.[8]\r\nThe art and science of designing buildings and (some) nonbuilding structures.[8]\r\nThe style of design and method of construction of buildings and other physical structures.[8]\r\nA unifying or coherent form or structure.[9]\r\nKnowledge of art, science, technology, and humanity.[8]\r\nThe design activity of the architect,[8] from the macro-level (urban design, landscape architecture) to the micro-level (construction details and furniture).\r\nThe practice of the architect where architecture means offering or rendering professional services in connection with the design and construction of buildings or built environments.[10]\r\nTheory\r\nMain articles: Architectural theory and Philosophy of architecture\r\n\r\nIllustration of bracket arm clusters containing cantilevers from Yingzao Fashi, a text on architecture by Li Jue (1065\u20131110)\r\nPlan d'ex\u00e9cution du second \u00e9tage de l'h\u00f4tel de Brionne (dessin) De Cotte 2503c \u2013 Gallica 2011 (adjusted)\r\nPlan of the second floor (attic storey) of the H\u00f4tel de Brionne in Paris \u2013 1734.\r\nThe philosophy of architecture is a branch of philosophy of art, dealing with aesthetic value of architecture, its semantics and in relation with development of culture.

Many philosophers and theoreticians from Plato to Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze,[11] Robert Venturi and Ludwig Wittgenstein have concerned themselves with the nature of architecture and whether or not architecture is distinguished from building.\r\n\r\nHistoric treatises\r\nThe earliest surviving written work on the subject of architecture is De architectura by the Roman architect Vitruvius in the early 1st century AD.[12] According to Vitruvius, a good building should satisfy the three principles of firmitas, utilitas, venustas,[13][14] commonly known by the original translation \u2013 firmness, commodity and delight. An equivalent in modern English would be:\r\n\r\nDurability \u2013 a building should stand up robustly and remain in good condition\r\nUtility \u2013 it should be suitable for the purposes for which it is used\r\nBeauty \u2013 it should be aesthetically pleasing\r\nAccording to Vitruvius, the architect should strive to fulfill each of these three attributes as well as possible. Leon Battista Alberti, who elaborates on the ideas of Vitruvius in his treatise, De re aedificatoria, saw beauty primarily as a matter of proportion, although ornament also played a part. For Alberti, the rules of proportion were those that governed the idealized human figure, the Golden mean. The most important aspect of beauty was, therefore, an inherent part of an object, rather than something applied superficially, and was based on universal, recognizable truths. The notion of style in the arts was not developed until the 16th century, with the writing of Giorgio Vasari.[15] By the 18th century, his Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects had been translated into Italian, French, Spanish, and English.\r\n\r\nIn the 16th century, Italian Mannerist architect, painter and theorist Sebastiano Serlio wrote Tutte L'Opere D'Architettura et Prospetiva (Complete Works on Architecture and Perspective). This treatise exerted immense influence throughout Europe, being the first handbook that emphasized the practical rather than the theoretical aspects of architecture, and it was the first to catalog the five orders.[16]\r\n\r\nIn the early 19th century, Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin wrote Contrasts (1836) that, as the title suggested, contrasted the modern, industrial world, which he disparaged, with an idealized image of neo-medieval world. Gothic architecture, Pugin believed, was the only \"true Christian form of architecture.\"[17] The 19th-century English art critic, John Ruskin, in his Seven Lamps of Architecture, published 1849, was much narrower in his view of what constituted architecture. Architecture was the \"art which so disposes and adorns the edifices raised by men ... that the sight of them\" contributes \"to his mental health, power, and pleasure\".[18] For Ruskin, the aesthetic was of overriding significance. His work goes on to state that a building is not truly a work of architecture unless it is in some way \"adorned\". For Ruskin, a well-constructed, well-proportioned, functional building needed string courses or rustication, at the very least.[18]\r\n\r\nOn the difference between the ideals of architecture and mere construction, the renowned 20th-century architect Le Corbusier wrote: \"You employ stone, wood, and concrete, and with these materials you build houses and palaces: that is construction. Ingenuity is at work. But suddenly you touch my heart, you do me good. I am happy and I say: This is beautiful.

While the notion that structural and aesthetic considerations should be entirely subject to functionality was met with both popularity and skepticism, it had the effect of introducing the concept of \"function\" in place of Vitruvius' \"utility\". \"Function\" came to be seen as encompassing all criteria of the use, perception and enjoyment of a building, not only practical but also aesthetic, psychological and cultural.\r\n\r\nNunzia Rondanini stated, \"Through its aesthetic dimension architecture goes beyond the functional aspects that it has in common with other human sciences. Through its own particular way of expressing values, architecture can stimulate and influence social life without presuming that, in and of itself, it will promote social development.... To restrict the meaning of (architectural) formalism to art for art's sake is not only reactionary; it can also be a purposeless quest for perfection or originality which degrades form into a mere instrumentality\".[21]\r\n\r\nAmong the philosophies that have influenced modern architects and their approach to building design are Rationalism, Empiricism, Structuralism, Poststructuralism, Deconstruction and Phenomenology.\r\n\r\nIn the late 20th century a new concept was added to those included in the compass of both structure and function, the consideration of sustainability, hence sustainable architecture. To satisfy the contemporary ethos a building should be constructed in a manner which is environmentally friendly in terms of the production of its materials, its impact upon the natural and built environment of its surrounding area and the demands that it makes upon the natural environment for heating, ventilation and cooling, water use, waste products and lighting.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nMain article: History of architecture\r\nOrigins and vernacular architecture\r\nMain article: Vernacular architecture\r\nIn Norway: wood and elevated-level\r\nIn Norway: wood and elevated-level\r\n \r\nIn Lesotho: rondavel stones\r\nIn Lesotho: rondavel stones\r\n \r\nIn Ireland: Yola hut\r\nIn Ireland: Yola hut\r\n \r\nIn Romania: peasant houses in the Dimitrie Gusti National Village Museum (Bucharest)\r\nIn Romania: peasant houses in the Dimitrie Gusti National Village Museum (Bucharest)\r\nBuilding first evolved out of the dynamics between needs (e.g. shelter, security, and worship) and means (available building materials and attendant skills). As human cultures developed and knowledge began to be formalized through oral traditions and practices, building became a craft, and architecture became the term used to describe the highly formalized and respected aspects of the craft. It is widely assumed that architectural success was achieved through trial and error, with progressively less trial and more replication as results became satisfactory over time.

Notable among these is the Deutscher Werkbund, formed in 1907 to produce better quality machine-made objects. The rise of the profession of industrial design is usually placed here. Following this lead, the Bauhaus school, founded in Weimar, Germany in 1919, redefined the architectural bounds prior set throughout history, viewing the creation of a building as the ultimate synthesis \u2013 the apex \u2013 of art, craft, and technology.\r\n\r\nWhen modern architecture was first practiced, it was an avant-garde movement with moral, philosophical, and aesthetic underpinnings. Immediately after World War I, pioneering modernist architects sought to develop a completely new style appropriate for a new post-war social and economic order, focused on meeting the needs of the middle and working classes. They rejected the architectural practice of the academic refinement of historical styles which served the rapidly declining aristocratic order. The approach of the Modernist architects was to reduce buildings to pure forms, removing historical references and ornament in favor of functional details. Buildings displayed their functional and structural elements, exposing steel beams and concrete surfaces instead of hiding them behind decorative forms. Architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright developed organic architecture, in which the form was defined by its environment and purpose, with an aim to promote harmony between human habitation and the natural world with prime examples being Robie House and Fallingwater.\r\n\r\nArchitects such as Mies van der Rohe, Philip Johnson and Marcel Breuer worked to create beauty based on the inherent qualities of building materials and modern construction techniques, trading traditional historic forms for simplified geometric forms, celebrating the new means and methods made possible by the Industrial Revolution, including steel-frame construction, which gave birth to high-rise superstructures. Fazlur Rahman Khan's development of the tube structure was a technological break-through in building ever higher.

As the first generation of modernists began to die after World War II, the second generation of architects including Paul Rudolph, Marcel Breuer, and Eero Saarinen tried to expand the aesthetics of modernism with Brutalism, buildings with expressive sculpture fa\u00e7ades made of unfinished concrete. But an even younger postwar generation critiqued modernism and Brutalism for being too austere, standardized, monotone, and not taking into account the richness of human experience offered in historical buildings across time and in different places and cultures.\r\n\r\nOne such reaction to the cold aesthetic of modernism and Brutalism is the school of metaphoric architecture, which includes such things as bio morphism and zoomorphic architecture, both using nature as the primary source of inspiration and design. While it is considered by some to be merely an aspect of postmodernism, others consider it to be a school in its own right and a later development of expressionist architecture.[27]\r\n\r\nBeginning in the late 1950s and 1960s, architectural phenomenology emerged as an important movement in the early reaction against modernism, with architects like Charles Moore in the United States, Christian Norberg-Schulz in Norway, and Ernesto Nathan Rogers and Vittorio Gregotti, Michele Valori, Bruno Zevi in Italy, who collectively popularized an interest in a new contemporary architecture aimed at expanding human experience using historical buildings as models and precedents.[28] Postmodernism produced a style that combined contemporary building technology and cheap materials, with the aesthetics of older pre-modern and non-modern styles, from high classical architecture to popular or vernacular regional building styles. Robert Venturi famously defined postmodern architecture as a \"decorated shed\" (an ordinary building which is functionally designed inside and embellished on the outside) and upheld it against modernist and brutalist \"ducks\" (buildings with unnecessarily expressive tectonic forms).", "start_char_idx": 27365, "end_char_idx": 31154, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a0273679-2fa8-4a83-8048-372c008a9f0c": {"__data__": {"id_": "a0273679-2fa8-4a83-8048-372c008a9f0c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "S:\\DemanualAI Inc\\C001P008\\cs-demo\\data\\architecture.txt", "file_name": "architecture.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 41337, "creation_date": "2024-04-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5c232cc8-c792-485e-a744-d9b0cfe3cf2d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "S:\\DemanualAI Inc\\C001P008\\cs-demo\\data\\architecture.txt", "file_name": "architecture.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 41337, "creation_date": "2024-04-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-30"}, "hash": "33cbc29ecd7fa27677d10dc755c35510d26ce59f946fd5f4af1a47bcd972eff4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2eb6e289-e3dd-4324-91de-9c643a70d39e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "S:\\DemanualAI Inc\\C001P008\\cs-demo\\data\\architecture.txt", "file_name": "architecture.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 41337, "creation_date": "2024-04-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-30"}, "hash": "6581b668179139300e181cee02cd19fe17952c340a690cbb507c185748b2725e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8615e99e-6b58-439f-bb58-ec4af01c0ff3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "15733c9a69931530d01e7300156a72f01d5603269c96d7a8b6f7915d2aedc428", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "[28] Postmodernism produced a style that combined contemporary building technology and cheap materials, with the aesthetics of older pre-modern and non-modern styles, from high classical architecture to popular or vernacular regional building styles.

Moreover, there has been an increased separation of the 'design' architect[Notes 1] from the 'project' architect who ensures that the project meets the required standards and deals with matters of liability.[Notes 2] The preparatory processes for the design of any large building have become increasingly complicated, and require preliminary studies of such matters as durability, sustainability, quality, money, and compliance with local laws. A large structure can no longer be the design of one person but must be the work of many. Modernism and Postmodernism have been criticized by some members of the architectural profession who feel that successful architecture is not a personal, philosophical, or aesthetic pursuit by individualists; rather it has to consider everyday needs of people and use technology to create livable environments, with the design process being informed by studies of behavioral, environmental, and social sciences.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental sustainability has become a mainstream issue, with a profound effect on the architectural profession. Many developers, those who support the financing of buildings, have become educated to encourage the facilitation of environmentally sustainable design, rather than solutions based primarily on immediate cost. Major examples of this can be found in passive solar building design, greener roof designs, biodegradable materials, and more attention to a structure's energy usage. This major shift in architecture has also changed architecture schools to focus more on the environment. There has been an acceleration in the number of buildings that seek to meet green building sustainable design principles. Sustainable practices that were at the core of vernacular architecture increasingly provide inspiration for environmentally and socially sustainable contemporary techniques.[30] The U.S. Green Building Council's LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) rating system has been instrumental in this.[31][quantify]\r\n\r\nConcurrently, the recent movements of New Urbanism, Metaphoric architecture, Complementary architecture and New Classical architecture promote a sustainable approach towards construction that appreciates and develops smart growth, architectural tradition and classical design.[32][33] This in contrast to modernist and globally uniform architecture, as well as leaning against solitary housing estates and suburban sprawl.[34] Glass curtain walls, which were the hallmark of the ultra modern urban life in many countries surfaced even in developing countries like Nigeria where international styles had been represented since the mid 20th Century mostly because of the leanings of foreign-trained architects.[35]\r\n\r\nTypes\r\n\r\nStourhead in Wiltshire, England, designed by Henry Hoare (1705\u20131785)\r\nResidential architecture\r\nResidential architecture is the design of functional fits the user's lifestyle while adhering to the building codes and zoning laws.\r\n\r\nCommercial architecture\r\nCommercial architecture is the design of commercial buildings that serves the needs of businesses, the government and religious institutions.", "start_char_idx": 30622, "end_char_idx": 35428, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8615e99e-6b58-439f-bb58-ec4af01c0ff3": {"__data__": {"id_": "8615e99e-6b58-439f-bb58-ec4af01c0ff3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "S:\\DemanualAI Inc\\C001P008\\cs-demo\\data\\architecture.txt", "file_name": "architecture.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 41337, "creation_date": "2024-04-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5c232cc8-c792-485e-a744-d9b0cfe3cf2d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "S:\\DemanualAI Inc\\C001P008\\cs-demo\\data\\architecture.txt", "file_name": "architecture.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 41337, "creation_date": "2024-04-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-30"}, "hash": "33cbc29ecd7fa27677d10dc755c35510d26ce59f946fd5f4af1a47bcd972eff4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a0273679-2fa8-4a83-8048-372c008a9f0c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "S:\\DemanualAI Inc\\C001P008\\cs-demo\\data\\architecture.txt", "file_name": "architecture.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 41337, "creation_date": "2024-04-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-30"}, "hash": "6dec1527e1d659d2e9b52ccf1acfc982debe0bd9a2d6d120109496bd1b941fb9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4fe603fd-0cc1-4cb9-a491-804ce3b7498a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0c90d95254e6778c686176683f2adced2d8c6aa00019147bb9cd3d4794867681", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "[32][33] This in contrast to modernist and globally uniform architecture, as well as leaning against solitary housing estates and suburban sprawl.[34] Glass curtain walls, which were the hallmark of the ultra modern urban life in many countries surfaced even in developing countries like Nigeria where international styles had been represented since the mid 20th Century mostly because of the leanings of foreign-trained architects.[35]\r\n\r\nTypes\r\n\r\nStourhead in Wiltshire, England, designed by Henry Hoare (1705\u20131785)\r\nResidential architecture\r\nResidential architecture is the design of functional fits the user's lifestyle while adhering to the building codes and zoning laws.\r\n\r\nCommercial architecture\r\nCommercial architecture is the design of commercial buildings that serves the needs of businesses, the government and religious institutions.[36]\r\n\r\nIndustrial architecture\r\nMain article: Industrial architecture\r\nIndustrial architecture is the design of specialized industrial buildings whose primary focus is designing buildings that are can fulfill its function while ensuring the safe movement of labor and goods in the facility.\r\n\r\nLandscape architecture\r\nMain article: Landscape architecture\r\nLandscape architecture is the design of outdoor public areas, landmarks, and structures to achieve environmental, social-behavioral, or aesthetic outcomes.[37] It involves the systematic investigation of existing social, ecological, and soil conditions and processes in the landscape, and the design of interventions that will produce the desired outcome. The scope of the profession includes landscape design; site planning; stormwater management; environmental restoration; parks and recreation planning; visual resource management; green infrastructure planning and provision; and private estate and residence landscape master planning and design; all at varying scales of design, planning and management. A practitioner in the profession of landscape architecture is called a landscape architect.\r\n\r\nInterior architecture\r\nMain article: Interior architecture\r\n\r\nCharles Rennie Mackintosh \u2013 Music Room 1901\r\nInterior architecture is the design of a space which has been created by structural boundaries and the human interaction within these boundaries. It can also be the initial design and plan for use, then later redesigned to accommodate a changed purpose, or a significantly revised design for adaptive reuse of the building shell.[38] The latter is often part of sustainable architecture practices, conserving resources through \"recycling\" a structure by adaptive redesign. Generally referred to as the spatial art of environmental design, form and practice, interior architecture is the process through which the interiors of buildings are designed, concerned with all aspects of the human uses of structural spaces.\r\n\r\nUrban design\r\nMain article: Urban design\r\nUrban design is the process of designing and shaping the physical features of cities, towns, and villages. In contrast to architecture, which focuses on the design of individual buildings, urban design deals with the larger scale of groups of buildings, streets and public spaces, whole neighborhoods and districts, and entire cities, with the goal of making urban areas functional, attractive, and sustainable.[39]\r\n\r\nUrban design is an interdisciplinary field that uses elements of many built environment professions, including landscape architecture, urban planning, architecture, civil engineering and municipal engineering.[40] It is common for professionals in all these disciplines to practice urban design. In more recent times different sub-subfields of urban design have emerged such as strategic urban design, landscape urbanism, water-sensitive urban design, and sustainable urbanism.\r\n\r\nOther types of architecture\r\nNaval architecture\r\nMain article: Naval architecture\r\n\r\nBody plan of a ship showing the hull form\r\nNaval architecture, also known as naval engineering, is an engineering discipline dealing with the engineering design process, shipbuilding, maintenance, and operation of marine vessels and structures.[41][42] Naval architecture involves basic and applied research, design, development, design evaluation and calculations during all stages of the life of a marine vehicle. Preliminary design of the vessel, its detailed design, construction, trials, operation and maintenance, launching and dry-docking are the main activities involved. Ship design calculations are also required for ships being modified (by means of conversion, rebuilding, modernization, or repair). Naval architecture also involves the formulation of safety regulations and damage control rules and the approval and certification of ship designs to meet statutory and non-statutory requirements.\r\n\r\nMetaphorical \"architectures\"\r\n\"Architecture\" is used as a metaphor for many modern techniques or fields for structuring abstractions.

It is also used to describe buildings in which seismic design considerations impacted its architecture. It may be considered a new aesthetic approach in designing structures in seismic prone areas.[46] The wide breadth of expressive possibilities ranges from metaphorical uses of seismic issues, to the more straightforward exposure of seismic technology. While outcomes of an earthquake architecture can be very diverse in their physical manifestations, architectural expression of seismic principles can also take many forms and levels of sophistication.[47]", "start_char_idx": 39023, "end_char_idx": 41118, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "98c3911b-57c4-49ca-9330-b100705ff181": {"__data__": {"id_": "98c3911b-57c4-49ca-9330-b100705ff181", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "S:\\DemanualAI Inc\\C001P008\\cs-demo\\data\\contact.txt", "file_name": "contact.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 285, "creation_date": "2024-04-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8fc9b94-8f39-4d11-bb26-68a552c08f0f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "S:\\DemanualAI Inc\\C001P008\\cs-demo\\data\\contact.txt", "file_name": "contact.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 285, "creation_date": "2024-04-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-30"}, "hash": "e88dce59d43642b0c5b999691dec4779a342ba874b34187a78eba35a505252b6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4fe603fd-0cc1-4cb9-a491-804ce3b7498a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "S:\\DemanualAI Inc\\C001P008\\cs-demo\\data\\architecture.txt", "file_name": "architecture.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 41337, "creation_date": "2024-04-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-30"}, "hash": "c9971adffd5e7f5f5f61c5e830893bd53e3638ff2e6ad9c261317dc4be391761", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9cb9f760-b972-43b9-b703-f6fdb617de83", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "172cecd09eb3f5cb15a54d9f1b6ecc9957cbfe24fdf613da0a9971fb5618c180", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "UAE Contact Info\nPhone number\n+971 58 577 8901\n\nEmail address\ninfo@jackgroups.com\n\nAddress info\nSRTIP - Sharjah, UAE.\nBLOCK B -B21 -165\n\n\nIndia Contact\nPhone number\n+91 93636 63421\n\nEmail address\ninfo@jackgroups.com\n\nAddress info\nNo. 16/8A, Redhills Road,\nAmbattur, Chennai \u2013 600053.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 283, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9cb9f760-b972-43b9-b703-f6fdb617de83": {"__data__": {"id_": "9cb9f760-b972-43b9-b703-f6fdb617de83", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "S:\\DemanualAI Inc\\C001P008\\cs-demo\\data\\data.txt", "file_name": "data.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1406, "creation_date": "2024-04-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7a727823-3292-4fb2-a50d-da2456084315", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "S:\\DemanualAI Inc\\C001P008\\cs-demo\\data\\data.txt", "file_name": "data.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1406, "creation_date": "2024-04-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-30"}, "hash": "e1f6af71c3e0f01b329b709aa49f0f1aff63ddb00265bc5af382b59dee9b5fb8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "98c3911b-57c4-49ca-9330-b100705ff181", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "S:\\DemanualAI Inc\\C001P008\\cs-demo\\data\\contact.txt", "file_name": "contact.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 285, "creation_date": "2024-04-30", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-30"}, "hash": "e88dce59d43642b0c5b999691dec4779a342ba874b34187a78eba35a505252b6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c4514f46-8b78-4e4b-bff4-3f5e4d9648ac", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4175d1a9005349ece100cafdac4274872ac432728e5a5b97a8567057da43c3f5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Home About Us Elevate U Portfolio Enquiry Contact Us # in \u00a9\n\n\u2018GROUP.\n\n \n\nWelcome to Jack Group\n\nJack Group is a provider of drafting and design services,\noffering a comprehensive range of solutions to transform your\nvision into reality.
